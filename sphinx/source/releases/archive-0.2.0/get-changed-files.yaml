    Running brassy with --get-changed-files now outputs the files that have been
    modified, added, deleted or moved in the current branch as compared to the main
    branch. It runs on the current directory by default,
    but it accepts a path as an argument.

    For example, the output looks like this:

    ::

        brassy --get-changed-files

            added: test
            modified: test2
            deleted: test3
            moved: test4

    It prints with indents for easy copy-and-pasting into your yaml files.
