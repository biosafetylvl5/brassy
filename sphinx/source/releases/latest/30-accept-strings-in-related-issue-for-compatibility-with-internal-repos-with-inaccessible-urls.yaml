enhancement:
- title: Add internal option to related issue
  description: Some organizations use internal repos that cannot be accessed by CI.
    This change adds an "internal" field for the related issue so that users can add
    strings directly rather than use the URL+issue number combo previously provided.
    The strings are rendered directly, but must fit a "repo#number - description"
    pattern. The field is named "internal" to suggest to users that when possible
    the URL option *should* be used to access future functionality.
